# PillPal
Medical app that reminds people to take their medication and makes medication management simple.

## What is PillPal?
PillPal has been undertaken to help individuals keep track of their daily medications. Many people have multiple prescriptions and it can be easy to lose track of them. This app aims to help manage that load. The PillPalâ€™s medium will be reminders set on a mobile device and optionally will work through Alexa. These reminders will tell a person or caregiver when the next time and dosage is along with an image of the medication and if a dose has been missed. This will be done through a series of text-based, mobile notification and/or vocal alerts. Furthermore, the PillPal will allow the user and/or caregiver to monitor usage and record any side effects. It will also have reminders of contraindications and when supply is running low for the given medication. An additional function would be a journal to allow people to recall any information regarding any changes in health such as vital signs, symptoms, sleep, reasoning for withheld medication, etc. The PillPal would allow people or caregivers to take their health into their own hands, including a better method to communicate information.
